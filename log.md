### 25. April

Starting at 15.1 points on kattis,
gonna work on the easy problems for
a few days. Then do harder problems. 
Computer isn't working, so i'll do 
competetive programming on my raspberry pi.
### 27. April
Not super focused on competetive programming,
got school, and fixed my PC so i'm back to working 
on compilers. I'll try to do a few now and then.
